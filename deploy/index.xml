Create infrastructure Go to /home/ec2-user/environment/rs-workshop/scripts directory cd /home/ec2-user/environment/rs-workshop/scripts Run the command below to create infrastructure, including: eks cluster istio efs elastic cache(redis) ./create-online-infra.sh This will take about ~20 minutes to provision
Verify the infrastructre already created successfully: kubectl get node The console looks like below:
