CloudShell is pre-authenticated with your console credentials. Common development and operations tools are pre-installed, so no local installation or configuration is required. With CloudShell, you can quickly run scripts with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), experiment with AWS service APIs using the AWS SDKs, or use a range of other tools to be productive.</description></item><item><title>Deploy a Lambda@Edge function to authenticate with Cognito</title><link>https://gcr-solutions.github.io/recommender-system-solution/deploy/online/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gcr-solutions.github.io/recommender-system-solution/deploy/online/readme/</guid><description>In this step, you will find and deploy one serverless application that have been published to the AWS Serverless Application Repository.
